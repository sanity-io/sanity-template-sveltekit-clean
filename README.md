## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18.13 or later)
* [Sanity CLI](https://www.sanity.io/docs/getting-started-with-sanity-cli) (optional)

### Setup Steps

#### 1. Install the template

Run the command in your Terminal to initialize this template on your local computer.

See the documentation if you are [having issues with the CLI](https://www.sanity.io/help/cli-errors).

```shell
npm create sanity@latest --template sanity-template-sveltekit-clean
```
The command prepares your SvelteKit app and Sanity Studio app.

Change directories into your app

```shell
cd <your app name>
```

#### 2. Run both the website and Sanity Studio locally

To run both apps locally you can simply run the first command here.  However, you still have the ability to run your website app and Sanity Studio app separately by changing directories into each of them and running `npm run dev`.

```shell
npm run dev
```
Or run them separately:
```shell
# For the SvelteKit app
cd app
npm run dev

# For Sanity Studio
cd studio
npm run dev
```

Your SvelteKit app will be live at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/)

### Adding Content

1. Open the Studio and create a new `Post` document.
2. Publish your changes.
3. Refresh the app to see your content live.

### Deployments

The `/app` and `/studio` folders are meant to be deployed separately.

#### How to deploy your Sanity Studio

Use this command to deploy your Studio. If youâ€™ve set a `SANITY_STUDIO_STUDIO_HOST` in `.env.production`, your Studio will deploy to `<SANITY_STUDIO_STUDIO_HOST>.sanity.studio` *if the subdomain is available*. Otherwise you'll be prompted to enter a Studio Hostname.

> Optionally, you have the freedom to host your Studio with the provider of your choice. [Learn more](https://www.sanity.io/docs/deployment) about hosting you Sanity Studio.

```shell
npx sanity deploy
```

#### How to deploy your SvelteKit app to Vercel

You have the freedom to deploy your SvelteKit app to your hosting provider of choice. With Vercel and GitHub being a popular choice, we'll cover the basics of that approach.

1. Create a GitHub repository from this project. [Learn more](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github) about how to create a GitHub repository.
2. Create a new Vercel project and connect it to your Github repository. 
3. **Important** - Set the `Root Directory` to your SveltKit app.

4. Configure your Environment Variables.

There are other ways deploy your app to Vercel without setting up a GitHub repository, but we won't be covering them. Reference the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) for more information.
